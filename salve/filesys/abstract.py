        This is meaningful in general, as creating an abstract file or

        file or directory creation has taken place. That would require an
        explicit creation action, which in the case of a virtualized filesys
        means (more or less) flipping a boolean flag, and in the case of a real
        filesystem means applying a mkdir or touch operation.
