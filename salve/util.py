        Usually, enum values are strings, so we map them to themselves
        for tidy output. For example

        >>> x = Enum('A','B')
        >>> print(x.A) # "A"
        >>> x.B == 'B' # True

        This should not be relied on in code for tests and control
        statements because the enum may be given explicitly named attrs
        like

        >>> x = Enum('A','B',C='x.C',D='Enum(x).D')

        in which case

        >>> print(x.C) # "x.C"
        >>> print(x.D) # "Enum(x).D"

        Instead, enums should be used in the traditional way for tests:

        >>> y = x.C
        >>> ...
        >>> if y == x.C:
        >>>     ...

        or

        >>> if y is x.C:
        >>>     ...

        is tests should pass because y is just another ref to the same
        string.
